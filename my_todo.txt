    * Tried to extract data from Json / CSV file from 
    https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Recreation-Park-Department-Park-Info-Dataset/z76i-7s65/data

    * Data Modelling was done (Many to Many ~~~~ users, parks, ratings....as well associate tables like favorites)

<May 8>

	* Worked on seed.py - feed data to database
	* Started with server side and render template

BLOCK:

	#### Should I use my database or use google map api for finding nearest parks#### ~~~~~~ Answer: Since I have a latitude and a longitude i can use Google Map Api

	#### Should I use dataSfgov API for park locations as well to show up in the map#### ~~~~~ Answer: Later, because I have started with it already.

	#### Can I use my data on latitude and logitude and show up in the map #### ~~~~~~~~~~ Answer: Sure.

To Do:

>>>>>>> Edit my csv file to have seperate latitude and longitude columns ----- Status : SUCCESS

>>>>>>> create a dummy file and check if you can retrieve all columns perfectly and then insert the file into load_parks function in the seed_db file ---- Status: SUCCESS

>>>>>>> Seed data into database and have a park table with all datas ---- Status: SUCCESS

>>>>>>>> Work server side to show up park location when an user types in a zipcode
